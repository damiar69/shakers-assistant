# How to Set Up Your Profile on Shakers

Whether you're a freelancer or a client, having a complete profile helps you get better matches and build trust. Follow these steps:

## 1. Choose a Professional Username and Photo
- Use a clear, high-resolution headshot.  
- Your display name should be easy to read, ideally your real name or a professional alias.

## 2. Write a Clear Bio / Description
- Freelancers:  
  - Briefly summarize your main experience (years worked, key technologies).  
  - Highlight 2-3 major accomplishments or projects.  

- Clients (employers):  
  - Specify what type of projects you are looking to post.  
  - Highlight your industry or market (e.g., “Fintech startups in Europe”).

## 3. Add Skills and Certifications
- Select from the predefined options (e.g., “Python”, “UI/UX Design”, “Data Analysis”).  
- If you have certifications (e.g., AWS Certified, Scrum Master), upload them as credentials.

## 4. Set your Hourly Rate (Freelancers)
- Decide your rate based on the market and your experience.  
- You can indicate ranges (e.g., “$30-$50 USD/hour”).

## 5. Add External Portfolio Links (Optional)
- GitHub, Behance, Dribbble, YouTube, etc.  
- Each link should point to recent and relevant work.

> **Tip**: Completing at least 80% of your profile increases your chances of receiving project invitations by 50%.
