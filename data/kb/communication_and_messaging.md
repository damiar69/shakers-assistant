# Communication & Messaging Best Practices on Shakers

Clear and timely communication improves collaboration and reduces rework.  

## 1. Send Initial Message to Freelancer
- Be brief and clear:  
  - Explain who you are, what you expect from the project and your budget.  
  - Example: “Hi Ana, I'm Maria, CEO of FinCraft. We need to migrate our API to Django. Our budget is $1,500 USD. Could you share an approximate timeline?”

## 2. Keep Updates in the Project Conversation.
- Always respond within the project channel (don't use external email).  
- Include screenshots, logs or links to code (GitHub, Google Docs).

## 3. Use Video Calls to Clarify Complex Points
- If a written explanation is ambiguous, request a video call (Skype, Zoom, Meet).  
- Be sure to record (or take notes) for later reference.

## 4. Feedback and Review
- When the freelancer delivers a milestone, provide timely feedback:  
  - “The login works correctly, but the `/users` endpoint does not return role information.”  
- Avoid vague comments such as “It doesn't work” or “Improve it.”

## 5. Resolve Disputes
- If there are misunderstandings, leave a record in the project chat.  
- Contact Shakers support if no agreement is reached within 48 hours.

**Note**: All conversations are recorded-use them for reference if there are discrepancies.
