 Payment Disputes & Refunds on Shakers

At Shakers, we use an escrow system to protect both parties. If there is a dispute, follow these steps:

## 1. Request Review with the Freelancer
- Communicate openly: state the problem with details (screenshots, logs, proofs).  
- Example: “The deliverable does not meet the agreed requirements (no unit tests). I request revision or refund.”

## 2. Open a Dispute Ticket in Shakers.
- Within the project, click on “Open Dispute”.  
- Complete the form with:  
  - Description of the failure.  
  - Attach evidence (documents, code, videos).  

## 3. Mediation Process
- Shakers support team will review both parties within 72 hours.  
- Additional video calls or evidence may be requested.

## Decision and Refund
- If a full refund request is accepted, Shakers releases the funds to the customer.  
- If a partial solution is accepted, only the funds corresponding to the validated work are released.

## 5. Closure
- Once the dispute is concluded, the platform will update the project status as “Dispute Resolved”.  
- The freelancer will lose the rating if the dispute is resolved against.

**Important**: Avoid initiating disputes for minor disagreements. First try an amicable settlement before escalating to support.
