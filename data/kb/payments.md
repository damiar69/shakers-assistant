# How Payments Work on Shakers

On Shakers, clients pay freelancers through an escrow system. The workflow is as follows:

1. The client creates a project and deposits funds into escrow.
2. The freelancer completes the work.
3. The client reviews the delivered work; if satisfied, the payment is released to the freelancer.
4. If a dispute arises, the Shakers support team mediates.
